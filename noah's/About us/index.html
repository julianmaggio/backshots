          A description of our vision for Bite The Bullet Games
        </h2>
        <p>
          We strive to make games that exceed previous limits, to test the
          boundaries of what can be done!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision is to step forward, to go where once thought impossible!
          and flourish, to create what others thought impossible! because
          impossible only means it's not done yet!
